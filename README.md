- 👋 Hi, I’m @RetroManiaMan
  
- 💼 I have created a company called System Technologies, also known as Syntex or Syntex Technologies!
  
- 📈 Making projects on Syntex people!
  
- 👀 I’m interested in race cars, Minecraft, cars, gadgets, motorsports, all that!
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning engineering (loving it!)
  
- 💞️ I’m looking forword to collaborating with different developers out there to create amazing and beautiful projects that will be know across the world! Afterall the moto of my company Syntex is "Incorperative developing, developers." If that makes sense to anyone!
  
- 🚫🧑🏾‍💻 I'm also a no-code developer. While there may not be many no-coders out there, I'm committed to supporting others in the community and continuing my work as a no-code developer, regardless of the challenges that may come.
  
- 📫 How to reach me/just email nwachukwuchimdi10@gmail.com!
  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
  
- ⚡ Fun fact:  Australia is wider than the Moon,
koalas have fingerprints, octopuses have three hearts,
and cherophobia is the fear of fun. Dolphins give each other names,
elephants can't jump, and honey never spoils!
